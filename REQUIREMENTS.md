# Project Requirements

## Problem

Teams need repeatable, evidence-based accessibility audits aligned with EN 301 549 / WCAG.

## Goals

- Deterministic audits
- Conservative compliance reporting
- File-based persistence
- Scalable to many sites/pages

## Non-goals

- UI dashboards
- Automatic fixes
- Manual audit replacement

## Constraints

- Must tolerate WAF / bot challenges
- Must not over-report compliance
- Must support future standards

## Success

The project succeeds if:
- Results are repeatable
- Outputs are explainable
- Audits can be aggregated later
